## Problem Statement:
In the context of traditional Bengali cuisine, the accurate classification and recognition of food items pose significant challenges due to variations in appearance, presentation, and environmental factors. Existing image recognition methods often struggle to achieve high accuracy in real-world applications, leading to potential misidentification and poor user experience. This project addresses the need for a robust solution by developing a deep learning framework utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the classification of traditional Bengali food images. By focusing on data preparation, GAN training for realistic image generation, and the implementation of advanced classification techniques, this research aims to improve accuracy and reliability in food recognition, ultimately contributing to better food identification and culinary education in Bengali culture.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust deep learning framework that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accurately classify traditional Bengali food images. This involves enhancing the model's performance through effective data preparation, realistic image generation, and advanced classification techniques. Ultimately, the project aims to achieve high classification accuracy, thereby improving the reliability of food recognition systems in real-world applications and fostering greater appreciation and understanding of Bengali culinary heritage.
